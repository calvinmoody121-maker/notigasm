Notigasm is a messaging app similar to WhatsApp—but with a chaotic edge.
Instead of sending normal, plain notifications, Notigasm weaponizes push notifications by delivering them in the most annoying, rude, and mischievous way possible.

For example:

You text your friend: "Hey, did you finish the math assignment?"

They receive a notification: "To-do list: Stop trying."

It’s a whole new way of communicating—playful, sarcastic, and slightly evil. Perfect for friends who can take a joke.

Features ✨

📱 Chat Interface – Send and receive messages like a normal messaging app.

🔔 Annoying Notifications – Push notifications replace your texts with sarcastic, rude, or chaotic phrases.

🤝 Friend-based Messaging – Works like WhatsApp: connect with contacts, but communication comes with chaos.

Why Notigasm? 🤔

Tired of polite, boring messaging apps?
Notigasm gives your group chats and one-on-one convos a gremlin twist, turning every conversation into a battlefield of annoying push notifications.

Instead of asking "WYD?", your friend might get:

"Reminder: Nobody cares."

It’s communication—but funnier, ruder, and more unforgettable.
